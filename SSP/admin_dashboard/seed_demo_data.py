# admin_dashboard/seed_demo_data.py
#
# Seeds the SIM_MODE-gated demo fixture file (database.db_manager.SIM_DB_NAME,
# i.e. SSP/database/ssp_database.sim.db) with realistic transactions spanning
# all four Source values and a wide enough time spread that /accounting's
# Today/Week/Month/All Time filters each show different, sensible totals
# (issue #18) — so the accounting page can be visually checked before the
# kiosk has accumulated any real transaction history.
#
# Never touches the real ssp_database.db: it only ever opens SIM_DB_PATH,
# a distinct file (already covered by .gitignore's `SSP/database/*.db`).
# Refuses to run unless SIM_MODE=true, so it can't be run by accident
# against a real-hardware checkout.
#
# Usage (from the repo root):
#   make seed-demo-data
#   # or directly:
#   SIM_MODE=true PYTHONPATH=SSP python -m admin_dashboard.seed_demo_data
